## Overview
The Goals:
1.	Create a genus and scientific name column from the provided information to get more detailed information on the types of plants
2.	Get the total number of plants
3.	Create a chart of the top 10 plants for each family
4.	Create a graph of the top 10 plants for each genus
5.	Create a graph of the top 10 plants for each scientific name
6.	Create charts to show the top 10 plants for each type of classification by count and percentage

## The Results
* In the data set, there were 16,351 plants from New York State.
* The most common plant family was “Asteraceae,” and the top 10 can be seen in the family_count.png.

* The most common plant genus was “Carex,” and the top 10 can be seen in the genus_count.png.

* The most common plant species classified under the scientific name was Deschampsia cespitosa, and the sci_name_count.png shows the top ten.

* Classification_percent.png to shows how the counts and percentages for the three types of classification compare with one another.

## Conclusion
The classification_percent.png shows the most interesting information related to plant classification. From the Family chart down to the Scientific Name, the counts and percentages decrease. This shows how scientific classification becomes more specific the closer you get to the scientific name.
